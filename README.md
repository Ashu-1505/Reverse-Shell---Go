# Reverse-Shell---Go
A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine initiates a connection to the attacker's machine, allowing the attacker to remotely execute commands on the target machine.
In a typical scenario, the attacker will use a tool or script to establish a network connection between the target machine and the attacker's machine, often by exploiting a vulnerability or by social engineering tactics. Once the connection is established, the attacker gains access to a command prompt or shell on the target machine, which allows them to execute commands as if they were physically present at the machine.
Reverse shells are often used in situations where direct access to a target machine is not possible or where traditional remote access methods are blocked or otherwise ineffective. They are commonly used by hackers and penetration testers to gain access to and control over remote machines, often for malicious purposes such as stealing sensitive data or launching further attacks. However, they can also be used by security professionals to test the security of their own systems and networks.
In this Package we implement Reverse Shell using GoLang using TCP connection. The server acts as an attacker system and the client acts as a victim system. When the client gets connected with the server, the server will be able to send the commands to the server and the client executes those commands and send the reply to the server.
